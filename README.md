# ASAteroids - React

ASAteroids is a modification of Base Defense Game, from the Games 101 course at chriscourses.com, located <a href=https://chriscourses.com/courses/javascript-games/videos/project-setup title="Chris Courses">here.</a>

ASAteroids is a towere-defense / shooter game similar to asteroids. 

The player is a stationary dot in the center of the screen, represented as the Dark Coin logo. The player can click / tap the map to shoot in that direction. 

Enemies will appear ramdomly at the edge of the map, represented by blockchain logos (BTC, ETH, DOGE, SOL, etc.), and move toward the player.

When the player shoots enemies, they will shrink/explode into particles. When an enemy shrinks, the player earns 100 points, and when an enemies explodes, the player earns 150 points.

When an enemy touches the player, the game ends and the final score is shown, with the option to restart a new game.
